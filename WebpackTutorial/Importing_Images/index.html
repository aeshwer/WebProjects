<!--PACKAGE.JSON : keep track of all dependencies needed by the project including webpack itself
Steps : 
1) run command :  npm init -y : geenrate default package json for our project.
2) run command :  npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev :Now we can install webpack .'--save-dev' add webpack as development depency in package.json
3)Configure webpack : done by adding config in 'webpack.config.js' . Create this file

Creating config file:
->> mention entry poiny file 
->> output file and its name and path
->> mention mode

In package.json add a script called "build" which runs webpack.

Now add changes in project - export /imports and then do this - 
1)nom run build

NOTE--------------------------For importing images we need to add rules for that in webpack.config.js
1) add 'module' property , it has rules array in  it and has 2 properties --'test' and 'use' .
2) add regix in 'test' for filetype.
3) For 'use' put the type of loader.
4) run command :  npm install file-loader --save-dev
