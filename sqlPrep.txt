SQL Questions: 

TABLES:
1)Use of Dual Table- used to perform Calcualtion,sequence generate and to select pseudo columns(sysdate or user)
	Eg:
	select 1*13 from  dual;   //(It has 1 row and 1 column and we can add more)
	select user from  dual;
        select sysdate from  dual;
	select Rownum r from  dual Connect By Rownum<=10;   (seq generate till 10)

2) How to backUp Table:
	We can use CTAS(Create As)
	Eg: select * from tableNew AS select * from tableSource

3) Can we drop all columns from a table?
	No - we get ORA-12983 error

4) What are Pseudo Column: behave like table column but are not stored in table,we can select them but cannot insert , update or delete their values
	Eg: Sysdate, RowID, RowNum ,etc

5) Diff between count(1) vs count(*)
	Nothing , They both are same in every aspect (return number of not null rows)

FILTERS:
1) Difference Between EXISTS and IN when using in subQuery?
	In : inner query is executed first and result is used for outer query . Inner query ran only once
	EXISTS : first row from outer query is selected , then inner query is executed and the outer query uses this output.The process then repeats for all rows of outer query

2) Difference Between HAVING and WHERE?
	WHERE : is used to filter out the data "before" the aggregation takes place 
	HAVING : is used to filter out the data "after" the aggregation takes place 
	Eg:
	select payment_term_detail_num from ref_payment_term_detail where payment_term_detail_num in(114,110,12,13)
	group by payment_term_detail_num having sum(payment_term_detail_num) >15

DELETE AND TRUNCATE
1) Which is faster between the two?
	DELETE : used to selectively delete rows using where if not given where then all rows are deleted. We need to commit or rollback to do/undo changes.Deletes triggers on that table are fired.
	TRUNCATE : removes all rows from table.It dont affect triggers or dependencies. We cannot rollback.It is faster than delete 

2) Can we delete a record from more than one table simultaneously?
	Yes, Eg:
	Delete t1,t2 from t1 INNERJOIN t2 where t1.id=t2.id AND t2.id=t3.id; 

3) How to delete duplicate records?
	Scenario : Table columns : department_Id, department_name ,branch . We have 2 same records.
	solution : we have no way of identifying thes 2 same rows, so we use pseudo column rowid and find minimum of both and delete one of them. Eg:
		delete from department d1 where d1.rowid >
		(    select min(d2.rowid) from department d2
		     where d1.department_Id, = d2.department_Id;
              	     and   d1.department_name = d2.department_name;
	             and   d1.branch=d2.branch;
		)

JOINS
1)  INNER : returns all rows from multiple table which match the condition
    LEFT OUTER :  returns all rows from left hand table specified in the "ON" condition and only thoes rows from other table whre joined fields are equal.
    SELF JOIN : table joins by itself
	Eg: select e1.name as employee_name
                   e2.ename as manager_name
		from emp e1, emp e2
		where e1.mgr = e2.empno;
